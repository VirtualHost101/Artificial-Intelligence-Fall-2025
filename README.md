# Artificial-Intelligence-Fall-2025

This repository contains the Python code for Part B of the AI Project.
It includes implementations for requirements R2, R3, R4, and R5:

- R2: Benefit calculation on a fixed small network
- R3: Top 3 roads for a random 60-node graph (f=0.6)
- R4: Top 3 roads for the same graph with f=0.8
- R5: Top 3 roads for a doubled connectivity network

Outputs for R3â€“R5 are displayed in notebook cells.
